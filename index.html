            <p style="font-family:calibri">I am Siddh Shah. I currently go to Plano Senior High School, and I am set to graduate in 2021. This website tells the 
               story of my Club Penguin remake.

      <h3 style="font-family:calibri">What is a Club Penguin Remake?</h3>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin">Club Penguin</a> is a dead virtual world in which children could
         create accounts as penguins and roam the island to make friends. It was previously owned by Disney.
         In March of 2017, Club Penguin was shut-down. A Club Penguin remake is essentially a re-run of the
         original game, Club Penguin, with the same visual files as the original game yet different 
         back-end code. Essentially, the creator of one of these would have to host all of the original
         visual files from Club Penguin on their own domain and would have to re-write the server code after
         heavy debugging. Then, the creator of this game would publish this content to the world on a 
         Virtual Private Server (VPS) and make it public.

      <h3 style="font-family:calibri">How did Vintage Penguin come to be?</h3>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">From around 3rd grade, I've always had an obsession with modifying the original game, Club Penguin. I 
         would test scripts to cheat-in coins or just change the speed of the game for my pure entertainment. I spent
         many hours just looking at the code because it excited me to see what would happen. Eventually, the game died
         in March of 2017. Club Penguin Remakes were a "trend" before Club Penguin died; however, I wanted to host my own
         at this point because I felt ready in my process of development and also had a pure desire to push my novel ideas
         onto the game. So, I met with a couple peers and began to code.

      <h3 style="font-family:calibri">Code Behind the Scenes</h3>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">Truly speaking, there were a lot of elements that were pushed to create this game. This section will briefly highlight them.</p>
	  </div>
      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">Backbone</h4>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">With just the visual files, penguins cannot login into the game. The game functions by listening to two constant
         server connections to let any penguins log into the game. <br></br><img src="code.png"></img><br></br> To code this part of the game,
         I had to process the "receiving" output from the visual files of a penguin logging in and verify their login information
         by using a random number algorithm. Direct passwords would not be sent for security reasons. After successfully processing
         the user's login information, a connection to a local SQL database would be made to get the user's items, igloo, ban status, friend's list, and other stuff
         from the database. Here's an example of a handler I coded for igloo competitions, written in PHP.
         <br></br><img src="code2.png"></img><br></br>
         This information would be communicated using packets that essentially detail information about the user; in this example,
         a loadPlayer (lp) packet is sent to give information about the user, "test9gdfgd" and his clothes. After getting the user to load in the world,
         the rest of the backbone became easy. The world of Vintage Penguin functioned off of room packets. Essentially, to show another the actions of the main user,
         the packets being sent by the main user would be repeated to all the penguins in the room. Essentially, each penguin had a socket connection
         to the game so they would receive any packets being sent. So, to make the world of Vintage Penguin function, 
         all I had to do was code response methods for any user actions. For example, when a user threw a snowball, I had to 
         simply tell the game to send this action to all users in the room, and the visual files would handle the rest. This pulls together
         actions from changing rooms to saying "Hello" to customizing one's igloo.

      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">The Website and Databasing</h5>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">With my amateur knowledge of HTML, I created the website for Vintage Penguin by pulling the majority of assets
      from the 2006 version of Club Penguin's website and pushing it onto my own. Then, I proceeded to add my own 
      edits by modifying tags and creating tabs for each part of the website. You can see the result <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171217154355/http://vintagepenguin.pw/">here.</a>
      However, one unique function of the website was the Sign Up! page. The user would use this to create a new user - it
      was one of the most tedious tasks as I had to make a secure connection to the database in which users would be stored.
      I learned the majority of how to use HTML tags and external scripts here. One last component of the website was
      the blog in which I was able to communicate with the community through that. I used WordPress, an open-source content management
      system, to host the blog, and I re-textured the design of it using old HTML to give it a 2006 feel. You can see this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180425000536/http://blog.vintagepenguin.pw/">here.</a>

      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">Front-end</h4>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">As there were other Club Penguin Remakes out there with different code, my server functioned around a theme
         to attract users. The theme of my server was the years of Club Penguin from 2005-2009. My intended audience was
         veteran Club Penguin players that wanted to satisfy their nostalgia. To do this, I had to re-texture all of the media-files
         from Club Penguin as well as modify the code to the looks of 2006. To accomplish this, I pulled together many
         old .swf (Adobe Flash) files and stole assets to create one giant file. Then, I added the handlers that connected with the back-end
         so that the user would still login with these re-designs. This same process was utilized to allow the Club Penguin 2006 homepage
         to function now - with bits and pieces of HTML instead. Here is one example. 
      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">Before</h4>
      <img src="home1.jpg"></img>
      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">After</h4>
      <img src="home2.png"></img>

      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">Daily Tasks</h4>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">From finishing both ends of the game, the rest of the management consisted mainly of texturing and front-end coding (as well as minor bug fixes). Much of the assets of 
      the 2006 Club Penguin used ActionScript 1.0 - essentially, this was an outdated version of flash that is no longer supported. So, if I were to use that
      content on my game, it would break and errors would result. To host many of the events, such as the Halloween Party or Holiday Party, I was
      tasked with re-writing the code for these files and making them function with the newest version of ActionScript. Here's an example of how I coded the files from the Christmas Party of 2007.
      <br></br><img src="code3.png"></img><br></br>
      Additionally, I would add new handlers for multiplayer minigames - one of the most difficult things for me to code. Some of these games included
      <a href="https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Sled_Racing">Sled Racing</a>, <a href="https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_Hunt">Treasure Hunt</a>, and <a href="https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Find_Four">Connect Four.</a>

      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">Security</h4>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">While I coded this, one of my biggest concerns was security. To make sure no exploits were used, I would always stay current
         on any news concerning the frameworks I utilized. Additionally, I made sure to never directly send passwords throughout connections and also
         encrypt them using BCrypt (link me!) to make the passwords as secure as possible. Overall, nothing significant happened to my remake. 
         We also did not have any conflicts with Disney via 17 U.S. Code ยง 107 on Fair use (link me!). However, this game
         definitely introduced me to the concepts of password-hashing and website-exploits.

      <h4 style="font-family:calibri">Conclusion</h4>
	  <div class="text">
      <p style="font-family:calibri">Overall, this was one of my most amazing adventures throughout high school. From PHP to ActionScript, this game literally stretched my horizons in programming by
         introducing me to so many programming languages. While ActionScript, the foundation of my game and Club Penguin, is set to die by the end of 2020, this game will hold a monumental
         place in my heart. Regardless of the programming experiences, I was able to meet individuals from all over the world and I was able to live my dream
         of pushing my own ideas into Club Penguin. I look forward to a future of pressing the horizons of programming and games.
